For this project, I used Summer Olympic Medals held every year from 1976 to 2008 and explored the analysis of the data. Additionally, used exploratory data analysis techniques such as cumulative distribution function(cdf), probability mass function(pmf), , complementary cdf , Pearsonâ€™s correlation, created scatterplots, bar charts, column charts.
