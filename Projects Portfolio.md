10 Project portfolio and their brief description to showcase in final portfolio.
1.	Weather API:

               This program connects with a web service in order to pull weather data. The program prompts the user for their city or zip code and request weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap. The program displays the weather information in a READABLE format to the user.
2.	Direct Marketing:

       This project showcases which characteristics of a household will result in high sales. The company collects data on previous customers that they have sent catalogs to. Through predictive analytics multiple models are presented to identify how much a person is predicted to spend.

3.	Heart disease prediction:
               This project seeks to analyze and understand to see if we can create a predictive modeling to know when a patient will have a heart failure disease based on their given health attributes. Additionally, it further test different machine learning models to find the most suitable predictive model.
4.	PetsDB (SQL project):
 	In this assignment, I connected to the supplied petsDB(Database) using sqlite3.connect() function to retrieve data from database. I  retrieved answers to questions such as “Which age group has maximum number of people?”, “How many people have more than one pet?”, “How many pets are there from the city called “east port”?”
5.	Web Scraping/Data Wrangling :
            In this project, I used web scraping, pulled API data, combined multiple data sources (API, website, CSV) together for analysis, use needed data modeling techniques to test hypothesis, use graphical tools to present data to tell the story, use Python, SQL to retrieve, clean, merge, store and automate dataset creation, and get knowledge of a data analysis project.
6.	Sentiment Analysis:
               This project was created where the program loads a data file and identifies a scheme to categorize each comment as positive or negative. Additionally, we use a tweet xlsx file to categorize if the written tweet by users could be categorized as positive or negative tweets.
7.	Airbnb prediction:
                    In this project, I use a dataset available on Kaggle from Airbnb of New York city to get information and business ideas about learning of different host and areas, such as common price range, frequency of neighborhood group for rooms (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and so on). Additionally, predict which type of room is more likely to be used in the future.
8.	Data Wrangling:
                In this assignment from previous class, I wrangled/manipulated data, generated necessary statistics, exploratory data analysis. Additionally, I also inserted data into SQL Lite database after creating a table.
9.	Credit Card Approval prediction:
             For this project, I created a predictive analytics to understand the credit card application and evaluate the applicants based on the attributes provided in the application form: age, credit payment history, sex, education, income, years employed and so on.
10.	Exploratory Data Analysis:
        For this project, I used Summer Olympic Medals held every year from 1976 to 2008 and explored the analysis of the data. Additionally, used exploratory data analysis techniques such as cumulative distribution function(cdf), probability mass function(pmf), , complementary cdf , Pearson’s correlation, created scatterplots, bar charts, column charts.
